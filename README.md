# Where In the World?

A responsive Progressive Web App (PWA) that allows users to view and search for information about countries around the world.

This project was created as a solution to the [REST Countries API with color theme switcher challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca).

## Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## API

This project uses the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) to fetch country data.

The API is free to use and does not require authentication.

The following endpoints were used:

- All - `https://restcountries.com/v2/all`
- CCCA3 Code - `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/alpha/{code}`

## Country Flags

The [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) provides country flags in PNG and SVG format from the [flagpedia.net API](https://flagpedia.net/download/api), but I did not use it because the flags have different aspect ratios, which caused inconsistent card sizes and large content shifts on the home page.

So I used [country-flag-icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/country-flag-icons), a package that provides country flags in a 3:2 aspect ratio.
